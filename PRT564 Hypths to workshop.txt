Victorian electricity market dynamics and usage throughout pandemic-forced change to working conditions ('working from home').

(we can reframe the RQs into hypotheses, such as Q1: "COVID19 has had a disequilibrating effect on energy consumption...")

Research Q1 - What effect has COVID19-forced WFH had on energy consumption / power prices?
[Average electricity consumption/demand and price statistics pre/post COVID19 pandemic (1 yr either side of March2020?)]

RQ2 - How has the cost of power been distributed/shared between employee/employer groups?   
x [Household costs of power(electricity) pre/post pandemic split by income and employment status] 
x [industry electricity costs/consumption pre/post pandemic  
x [CBD electricity demand pre/post pandemic, per city  (this gives proxy measure of pandemic effect size on commercial enterprise: cities relatively uneffected such as Darwin expected to have little variation in CBD electircty use pre/post; by contrast Melbourne highly significant difference]

RQ3 - Has household-generated (solar) electricity had an observable effect upon pre/post pandemic WFH power consumption? 
[average electiricity demand from regions with high solar penetration vs low penetration rates]

RQ4 - What insights do these data provide for equity concerns around future employer-employee WFH-flexiblity contractual arrangements?

RQ5 - How has solar radiation/exposure effected the price and demand of electricty - before and after pandemic?

Data Processing: Rubric guide
"Data profiling technique demonstrates proficient use and interpretation of measures of central tendency, measures of spread, inferential statistics, and probability.  
Incoporate high quality and informative Python visualisation that support effective initial data exploration.  
Data wrangling proficiency is demonstrated."


Workflow:

Data wrangling

1.Trim dataset
(i) Reduce time horizon to 1 (or2?) years until final row (6 Oct 2020):
- 2019/10/06 to 2020/10/06  or
- 2018/10/06 to 2020/10/06


(ii) create extra columns:   
temp_ave (midpoint of temp range) = max_temp - min_temp

(iii)
Reduce unneccessary dimensions/columns
(unless these offer any interesting insights?)
Keep:  date, demand, RRP, frac_at_neg_RRP, solar exposure, temp_ave(new)

2. Profile
- outlier analysis
- removal*

3. Cleave dataset
Profile data over two time series:  pre & post 23/03/2020 (date of first lockdown):
(i) run descriptive stats over the dual time-series for each variable of interest. 

print(df.describe())*
