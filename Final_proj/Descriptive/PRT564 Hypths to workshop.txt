Australian energy equity under working from home (WFH) conditions:

(we can reframe the RQs into hypotheses, such as Q1: "COVID19 has had a disequilibrating effect on energy consumption...")

Research Q1 - What effect has COVID19-forced WFH had on energy consumption / power prices?
[Average electricity consumption/demand and price statistics pre/post COVID19 pandemic (1 yr either side of March2020?)]

RQ2 - How has the cost of power been distributed/shared between employee/employer groups?
[Household costs of power(electricity) pre/post pandemic split by income and employment status]
[industry electricity costs/consumption pre/post pandemic
[CBD electricity demand pre/post pandemic, per city  (this gives proxy measure of pandemic effect size on commercial enterprise: cities relatively uneffected such as Darwin expected to have little variation in CBD electircty use pre/post; by contrast Melbourne highly significant difference]

RQ3 - Has household-generated (solar) electricity had an observable effect upon pre/post pandemic WFH power consumption? 
[average electiricity demand from regions with high solar penetration vs low penetration rates]

RQ4 - What insights do these data provide for equity concerns around future employer-employee WFH-flexiblity contractual arrangements?
