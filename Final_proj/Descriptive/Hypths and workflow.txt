Topic (under devlpmnt):
Victorian electricity market dynamics during economic restrictions enforced by pandemic; in particular, state wide adjustments to working and lifestyle conditions ('working from home', WFH).

H1. COVID19 economic 'lockdown' restrictions (and continued change to working conditions) caused a redution in consumption/demand of electrical energy across Victoria.

H2. Lower demand post-pandemic (during lockdowns) resulted in lower power prices.

H3. Solar energy exposure reduced/reduces the price and demand of electricity (pre and post lockdown?). 

H4. High exposure of solar energy had a greater effect on market/network demand during lockdown restrictions / post-pandemic 
    (because solar generation is consumed locally, reducing distribution demand across network) 

H5. To what extent / How much effect (correlation) does solar energy radiation have upon power prices and nework demand?

---Workflow----

1. Data wrangling:

(i) Trim dataset
Reduce length to 1 (or2?) years until final row (6 Oct 2020):
- 2019/10/06 to 2020/10/06  or
- 2018/10/06 to 2020/10/06   ?

(ii) create extra columns:   
temp_ave (midpoint of temp range) = max_temp - min_temp

(iii)  Reduce unneccessary dimensions/columns
(unless explrty analysis brings any interesting insights?)
Variables to keep:  date, demand, RRP, frac_at_neg_RRP, solar exposure, temp_ave(new)


2. Exploritory Analysis:

(i) Cleave trimmed dataset into two time series:  pre(<) & post(>=) 23/03/2020 (date of first lockdown)

(ii) outlier analysis & removal* (maybe - may be best to present visualisaitons of outliers, but not yet remove)

Profile Data
(iii) Run descriptive stats over the dual time-series (6/10/19-22/3/20 & 23/3/20-6/10/20) 
    - for each variable of interest. 


From assignment rubric - Data Processing:
"Data profiling technique demonstrates proficient use and interpretation of measures of central tendency, measures of spread, inferential statistics, and probability.  
Incoporate high quality and informative Python visualisation that support effective initial data exploration.  
Data wrangling proficiency is demonstrated."


[[print(df.describe())*  --Yakub refered to using this command halfway through last WS (15/4).  I didnt catch whether he meant for As2 or As3]
